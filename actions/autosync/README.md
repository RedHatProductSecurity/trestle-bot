### Additional information on workflow inputs

- `markdown_path`: This is the location for Markdown generated by the `trestle author <model>-generate` commands
- `ssp_index_path`: This is a text file that stores the component definition information by name in trestle with the ssp name. Example below

```json
 "ssp1": {
            "profile": "profile1",
            "component definitions": [
                "comp1",
                "comp2"
            ]
        },
```

## Action Behavior

The purpose of this action is to sync JSON and Markdown data with `compliance-trestle` and commit changes back to the branch or submit a pull request (if desired). Below are the main use-cases/workflows available:

- The default behavior of this action is to run a trestle `assemble` and `regenerate` tasks with the given markdown directory and model and commit the changes back to the branch the workflow ran from ( `github.ref_name` ). The branch can be changed by setting the field `branch`. If no changes exist or the changes do not exist with the file pattern set, no changes will be made and the action will exit successfully.

```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run trestlebot
      id: trestlebot
      uses: RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/actions/autosync@main
      with:
        markdown_path: "markdown/profiles"
        oscal_model: "profile"
        branch: "another-branch"
```

- If the `target_branch` field is set, a pull request will be made using the `target_branch` as the base branch and `branch` as the head branch.

```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run trestlebot
      id: trestlebot
      uses: RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/actions/autosync@main
      with:
        markdown_path: "markdown/profiles"
        oscal_model: "profile"
        branch: "autoupdate-${{ github.run_id }}"
        target_branch: "main"
        github_token: ${{ secret.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- When `check_only` is set, the trestle `assemble` and `regenerate` tasks are run and the repository is checked for changes. If changes exists, the action with exit with an error. This can be useful if you only want to check that the content is in sync without making any changes to the remote repository.

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run trestlebot
        id: trestlebot
        uses: RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/actions/autosync@main
        with:
          markdown_path: "markdown/profiles"
          oscal_model: "profile"
          check_only: true
```

> Note: Trestle `assemble` or `regenerate` tasks may be skipped if desired using `skip_assemble: true` or `skip_regenerate: true`, respectively.
