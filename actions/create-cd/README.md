## Action Behavior

The purpose of this action is to create a new component definition and commit changes back to the branch or submit a pull request (if desired). Below are the main use-cases/workflows available:

- The default behavior of this action is to create a new component definition and commit the changes back to the branch the workflow ran from ( `github.ref_name` ). The branch can be changed by setting the field `branch`. If no changes exist or the changes do not exist with the file pattern set, no changes will be made and the action will exit successfully.

```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run trestlebot
      id: trestlebot
      uses: RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/actions/create-cd@main
      with:
        markdown_path: "markdown/components"
        profile_name: "profile"
        component_definition_name: "component-definition"
        component_title: "My Component Title"
        component_description: "My Component Description"
        branch: "another-branch"
```

- If the `target_branch` field is set, a pull request will be made using the `target_branch` as the base branch and `branch` as the head branch.

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      with:

        profile_name: "profile"
        component_definition_name: "component-definition"
        component_title: "My Component Title"
        component_description: "My Component Description"
        branch: "create-cd-${{ github.run_id }}"
        target_branch: "main"
