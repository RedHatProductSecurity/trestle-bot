trestle-bot assists users in leveraging [Compliance-Trestle](https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-trestle) in CI/CD workflows for [OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) formatted compliance content management.

> WARNING: This project is currently under initial development. APIs may be changed incompatibly from one commit to another.

## Getting Started

### Available Commands

The `autosync` command will sync trestle-generated Markdown files to OSCAL JSON files in a trestle workspace. All content under the provided markdown directory when the action is run will be transformed. This action supports all top-level models [supported by compliance-trestle for authoring](https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/).

The `rules-transform` command can be used when managing [OSCAL Component Definitions](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.1/component-definition/json-outline/) in a trestle workspace. The action will transform rules defined in the rules YAML view to an OSCAL Component Definition JSON file.

The `create-cd` command can be used to create a new [OSCAL Component Definition](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.1/component-definition/json-outline/) in a trestle workspace. The action will create a new Component Definition JSON file and corresponding directories that contain rules YAML files and trestle-generated Markdown files. This action prepares the workspace for use with the `rules-transform` and `autosync` actions.

The `sync-upstreams` command can be used to sync and validate upstream OSCAL content stored in a git repository to a local trestle workspace. Which content is synced is determined by the `include_model_names` and `exclude_model_names` inputs.

The `create-ssp` command can be used to create a new [OSCAL System Security Plans](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/v1.1.1/system-security-plan/json-outline/) (SSP) in a trestle workspace. The action will create a new SSP JSON file and corresponding directories that contain trestle-generated Markdown files. This action prepares the workspace for use with the `autosync` action by creating or updating the `ssp-index.json` file. The `ssp-index.json` file is used to track the relationships between the SSP and the other OSCAL content in the workspace for the `autosync` action.

Below is a table of the available commands and their current availability as a GitHub Action:

| Command            | Available as a GitHub Action |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `autosync`         | &#10003;                     |
| `rules-transform`  | &#10003;                     |                   
| `create-cd`        | &#10003;                     |
| `sync-upstreams`   | &#10003;                     |
| `create-ssp`       |                              |

### Run as a Container

> Note: When running the commands in a container, all are prefixed with `trestlebot` (e.g. `trestlebot-autosync`). The default entrypoint for the container is the autosync command.

Build and run the container locally:

```bash
podman build -f Dockerfile -t trestle-bot .
podman run -v $(pwd):/data -w /data trestle-bot
```

Container images are available in `quay.io`:

```bash
podman run -v $(pwd):/data -w /data quay.io/continuouscompliance/trestle-bot:<tag>
```
