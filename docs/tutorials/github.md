# GitHub Tutorial

This tutorial provides an introduction to using `trestlebot` with GitHub.  We will be using a single GitHub repository for our trestle authoring workspace and executing the `trestlebot` commands as GitHub actions.  Note, each repo is intended to support authoring a single OSCAL model type (SSP, component definition, etc.).  If authoring more than one, then a dedeicated repository should be used for each model.


### 1. Prerequisites

Before moving on, please ensure you have completed the following:

1. Create a new (or use an existing) empty GitHub repository
2. Clone the repo to your local workstation
3. Install trestlebot
    * Option 1: Clone the [trestle-bot](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/tree/main) repo to your local workstation and run `poetry install`
    * Option 2: Use the [trestlebot container image](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#run-as-a-container)


### 2. Set Permissions for GitHub Actions

The `trestlebot` commands will be run inside of GitHub actions.  These commands often perform `write` level operations against the repo contents.  The GitHub workflows generated in this tutorial make use of [automatic token authentication.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)  To ensure this is configured correct the following repo settings need to be in place.

*Note: If you choose an alternative method to provide repo access such as personal access tokens or GitHub apps you can skip these steps.*

1. Click the `Settings` tab for your GitHub repo 
2. Select `Actions` -> `General` from the left-hand menu
3. Scroll down to `Workflow permissions`
4. Ensure `Read repository contents and packages permissions` is selected
5. Ensure `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` is checked

### 3. Initialize trestlebot Workspace

We will now use the `trestlebot init` command to initialize our emtpy GitHub repository.  Unlike the other trestlebot commands, this command is run on your local workstation.  The trestlebot commands can be installed by cloning the [trestle-bot](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot/tree/main) repo and running `poetry install`.  Alternatively these commands can be run using the [trestlebot container image](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/trestle-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#run-as-a-container). For this tutorial we will be authoring a component-definition.

```
trestlebot-init --oscal-model compdef --working-dir <path-to-your-repo>
```

Using container image:

```
podman run -v <path-to-your-repo>:/data:rw  trestle-bot:latest --oscal-model compdef --working-dir /data
```

You should now see the following directories in your repo.


```bash
.
├── catalogs
├── component-definitions
├── markdown 
├── profiles
├── rules
├── .trestle
└── .trestlebot
```

You can now add any catalog or profile content needed for you authoring process.  For this example, we will add the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 catalog to our `/catalogs` directory.

```
mkdir catalogs/nist_rev5_800_53
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/release-v1.0.5-update/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json -O catalogs/nist_rev5_800_53/catalog.json
```

Now we will add the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 High Baseline profile to our `profiles/` directory.

```
mkdir profiles/nist_rev5_800_53
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/release-v1.0.5-update/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5/json/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_HIGH-baseline_profile.json -O profiles/nist_rev5_800_53/profile.json
```

Our `profile.json` file contains a reference to our `catalog.json` file.  By default, this path is not resolvable by compliance-trestle, so we need to run the following command to update the `href` value in the JSON.

```
sed -i 's/NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json/trestle:\/\/catalogs\/nist_rev5_800_53\/catalog.json/g' profiles/nist_rev5_800_53/profile.json
```

Finally you can copy ready-made CI/CD workflows from the `TEMPLATES` directory into your workspace. These are the trestlebot actions that will run as we make changes to the repo contents.

**For example Component Definition authoring in GitHub Actions**
```
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp TEMPLATES/github/trestlebot-create-component-definition.yml .github/workflows
cp TEMPLATES/github/trestlebot-rules-transform.yml .github/workflows
```

Now that we have the initial content needed to begin authoring, go ahead and commit and push to the remote GitHub repo.


### 4. Create a New Component Definition

Now it's time to run our first trestlebot action!  We will go ahead and create our first component definition.

1. Open to your GitHub repo in a web browser.
2. Click to the `Actions` tab from the top menu.
3. Click the `Trestle-bot create component definition` action from the left-hand menu.
4. Click `Run Workflow` which will open up a dialog box.
5. Enter the following values:

* _Name of the Trestle profile to use for the component definition:_ `nist_rev5_800_53`
* _Name of the component definition to create:_ `my-first-compdef`
* _Name of the component to create in the generated component definition:_ `test-component`
* _Type of the component (e.g. service, policy, physical, validation, etc.):_ `service`
* _Description of the component to create:_ `Testing trestlebot init`

6. Click `Run Workflow`

Once the workflow has completed you should have a new Pull Request containing the files trestlebot generated for the component definition.  After reviewing the files you can go ahead and merge the PR!

Congrats, you have successfully created a new trestlebot workspace and now have an authoring environment!
