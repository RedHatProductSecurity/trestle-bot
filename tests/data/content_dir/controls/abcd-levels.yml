    description: "The organization:\n a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment:\
      \ organization-defined personnel or roles]:\n   1. An access control policy that\
      \ addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination\
      \ among organizational entities, and compliance; and\n   2. Procedures to facilitate\
      \ the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls;\
      \ and\n b. Reviews and updates the current:\n   1. Access control policy [Assignment:\
      \ organization-defined frequency]; and\n   2. Access control procedures [Assignment:\
      \ organization-defined frequency].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control addresses\
      \ the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation\
      \ of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy\
      \ and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,\
      \ regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and\
      \ procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies\
      \ and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general\
      \ information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented\
      \ by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations.\
      \ The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for\
      \ particular information systems, if needed. \n\nThe organizational risk management\
      \ strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control:\
      \ PM-9.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: NIST Special Publications 800-12,\
      \ 800-100.\n\nAC-1 (b) (1) [at least annually] \nAC-1 (b) (2) [at least annually\
      \ or whenever a significant change occurs]"
